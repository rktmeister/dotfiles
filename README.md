# Dotfiles

This repository contains all the necessary dotfiles that I need for any Linux machine.

## Setup

Clone this repo in the `$HOME` directory, cd into `dotfiles/`, and then run `stow --adopt .` to create the symlinks.

If stow is not yet installed, you should do so with whatever package manager your OS is using.
