Use session id $ARGUMENTS from `conversations.json` and then simply continue where you left off with gemini with regards to the code debugging session. Remember to always provide all necessary context to Gemini (e.g. all relevant code blocks) in order to give Gemini the best possible chance to help us during debugging. Remember, if you have any questions that needs clarifying from gemini, feel free to ask additional clarifying questions to gemini before you start writing code / explaining the plan that you're going to take.
