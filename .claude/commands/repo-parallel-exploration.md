Launch $ARGUMENTS subtasks to explore this repo in parallel and then write REPO_GUIDE.md for future AI agents that comprehensively distills the key files and features. Pay particular attention to the readmes and other documentation, and if insufficient, also write yourself a getting started guide. This will serve to bootstrap future AI agents without the need to explore the repo upon each startup. Never use emojis, other AI agents and humans may not like them so this document should be "professional".
